# How to send a reminder email to participants of a doodle

During my PhD...

Reshaping an excel file issued from doodle and sending an reminder email the day before the meeting...

## A minimal example

I have set up an example doodle available following this link: https://doodle.com/poll/g7vee2qy2swhmt9g

So far,

## Sending emails from R

Blah blah... https://github.com/jennybc/send-email-with-r

## Scheduling it (for Mac OSX)

Blah blah ... https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/schedule-automator-workflow-or-app.1996548/

NB: this script might need to be adapted a bit if participants of the doodle can choose multiple (more than one) dates and/or if some participants chose no date.
